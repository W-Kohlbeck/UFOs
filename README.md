# UFOs

## Summary
For this project the goal was to create a site to include filterable data on UFO sightings. Users need to be able to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.

### Tools Used
1. Java Script
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Bootstrap

## Results
After setting up the website and building the table using the supplied data I was able to create five different search boxes that will filter the datat to give specific sightings. 

Displayed below is an image of the site with no filters set.

In order for the information to be filtered a user will need to input any of the necessary categories. Demonstrated below the user filtered by the date and state. The results were returned with three sightings.

## Conclusion
Both the function and display of the UFO Sightings site are functioning as necessary. There a few additional items that would help with the ease of use and function of the site however. First in order to reset the filter the site needs to either be refreshed or the link at the very top of the page pressed to refresh the site. It would be good to have a button closer to the filters themselves that would reset all filters. Secondly in order to filter the data the info entered needs to match the data exactly. This could cause issues with the displayed results if for example someone were to enter the state in capital letters such as "CA" vs "ca".
